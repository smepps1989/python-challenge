This module consists of two projects which explore the principles of reading .csv files into Python dictionaries using the os and csv modules, looping through these created dictionaries, and performing analyses.

The first project, PyBank, was created to analyze the profits and losses of a bank by month over time. Instead of having to do all the analysis in Excel, this program simplifies the process of finding what the profit and loss was between the months on average, the month and year of the greatest increase and how much that profit was, and the month and year of the greatest loss as well as that amount. To start, the .csv file was read into a dictionary which was then looped to find these values as well as the net profit/loss amount. More details are provided in the .py files themselves as notes.

The second project, PyPoll, was created to greatly reduce the time it takes to tally up votes for candidates in a political race. The goal was to find how many votes went to each candidates, calculate the percentage of all votes that went to each candidate, and to announce the winner.

Both .py files print out a results .csv summarizing the results.
